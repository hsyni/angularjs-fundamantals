AngularJS Customer Management Application
This project demonstrates a simple customer management application using core AngularJS features like data binding, directives, routing, and controllers.

Features
Customer Listing: Display existing customers in a table/list format.

Customer Addition: Add new customer records.

Customer Filtering: Filter the customer list by name.

View Routing: Navigate between different views (View1, View2) within the application.

Technologies Used
AngularJS (v1.8.2): Frontend JavaScript framework.

HTML5: Structural backbone of the application.

CSS3: Basic styling and layout adjustments.

Tailwind CSS (CDN): Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling and a modern look.

JavaScript: Application logic.

How to Run
This application can be run directly in a web browser without any server setup.

Clone this repository to your local machine or download the .html file.

Open the downloaded .html file (e.g., usingDirectivesWithDatabinding.html) in your preferred modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

Important Note: If the customer list does not appear or the page is blank when opened in the browser, ensure that #/view1 is automatically appended to the URL after the hash (#) symbol. For example:
http://127.0.0.1:5500/usingDirectivesWithDatabinding.html#/view1

(The application is configured to automatically redirect to this route on initial load in local server environments, but manual verification might be necessary in some browser or server setups.)
